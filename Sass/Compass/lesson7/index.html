First, you need to set the line height, or the leadingfor your body text. The leading is
the distance between successive base lines of text, your vertical rhythm and unit by
which you’ll add whitespace down the page. This means that all elements need to have
a height that’s a multiple of this base unit, adding up font size, line height, top and
bottom padding, and top and bottom margin for the element. In the next few sections, we’ll construct a layout and employ a vertical rhythm. In each step, we’ll demonstrate the CSS involved, and the Compass shortcuts to get the same result in less time.
